# Scientific Paper to MDC Conversion Rules

## CRITICAL PROTOCOL: COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION MANDATE

> **⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:** This document is not optional. Every scientific paper MUST be processed with complete thoroughness. The resulting MDC must be so comprehensive that a developer could implement the technique WITHOUT reading the original paper. Incomplete MDCs are unacceptable and must be redone.

## Final Reminders

### The Golden Rules

1. **Completeness Over Speed:** It's better to take longer and be complete than to rush and miss content.

2. **Accuracy Over Convenience:** Always verify accuracy, even if it's inconvenient.

3. **Detail Over Summary:** Extract details, not summaries. The MDC should be comprehensive.

4. **Understanding Over Extraction:** Don't just extract—understand. Understanding leads to better MDCs.

5. **Quality Over Quantity:** One excellent, comprehensive MDC is better than multiple incomplete ones.

### Success Criteria

An MDC is successful if:

- A developer can implement the technique without reading the original paper
- All code examples are complete and runnable (or clearly marked as pseudocode)
- All algorithms are fully described
- All formulas are correct and in LaTeX
- All results are accurately represented
- All concepts are clearly explained
- The MDC is well-organized and easy to navigate
- The README clearly explains how to use the MDC

### Remember

You are creating a "Source of Truth" document. It must be:
- **Complete:** Nothing important is missing
- **Accurate:** Everything is correct
- **Comprehensive:** Everything is detailed
- **Actionable:** Developers can use it to build
- **Reliable:** It can be trusted as the definitive reference

**There are no shortcuts. There are no acceptable compromises. The MDC must be incredibly comprehensive and detailed.**
