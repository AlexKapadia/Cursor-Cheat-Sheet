# Scientific Paper to MDC Conversion Rules

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for converting scientific papers (PDFs) about coding techniques and building methods into MDC cheat sheets. These rules ensure complete paper coverage, accurate extraction, and proper file organization.

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL:** When processing a scientific paper, you MUST follow these rules in strict order. No shortcuts. Every section of the paper must be read and processed.

---

## Phase 1: Complete Paper Reading Protocol

### MANDATORY Multi-Pass Reading Strategy

You MUST perform three complete passes through the entire paper before creating any MDC content. This ensures nothing is missed.

#### Pass 1: Full Paper Structure Scan
**Objective:** Understand the complete structure and organization of the paper.

**Actions Required:**
1. Read the entire paper from beginning to end without stopping
2. Identify all major sections:
   - Title, Authors, Abstract
   - Introduction
   - Related Work / Background
   - Methodology / Approach
   - Implementation Details
   - Results / Evaluation
   - Discussion / Analysis
   - Conclusion / Future Work
   - References
3. Note any appendices, supplementary materials, or code listings
4. Identify the paper's primary focus (coding technique, architecture pattern, algorithm, etc.)
5. Document the paper's structure in a temporary outline

**Verification:** You must be able to list all sections and their approximate locations before proceeding.

#### Pass 2: Section-by-Section Detailed Extraction
**Objective:** Extract all technical content, code examples, algorithms, and key concepts.

**Actions Required:**
1. Go through each section systematically
2. For each section, extract:
   - **Key concepts and definitions**
   - **Algorithms and pseudocode** (convert to readable format)
   - **Code examples** (identify programming language)
   - **Mathematical formulas** (preserve in LaTeX format)
   - **Diagrams/figures descriptions** (detailed text descriptions)
   - **Performance metrics and benchmarks**
   - **Implementation details and patterns**
   - **Best practices mentioned**
   - **Limitations and assumptions**
   - **Related techniques referenced**
3. Mark any code blocks with their language
4. Note any tables and extract their data
5. Capture all technical terminology and definitions

**Verification:** Every section must have extracted content. If a section appears empty, re-read it.

#### Pass 3: Cross-Reference Validation
**Objective:** Ensure completeness and identify relationships between sections.

**Actions Required:**
1. Cross-reference all code examples mentioned in text with actual code blocks
2. Verify all algorithms are captured with their complete logic
3. Check that all mathematical formulas are extracted
4. Ensure all performance metrics are documented
5. Validate that all referenced techniques are noted
6. Confirm all implementation patterns are captured
7. Check for any "TODO" or "future work" items that might be relevant
8. Verify no section was skipped or partially read

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] All sections read completely
- [ ] All code examples extracted with language tags
- [ ] All algorithms documented
- [ ] All formulas in LaTeX format
- [ ] All performance metrics captured
- [ ] All implementation details noted
- [ ] All best practices extracted
- [ ] All limitations documented
- [ ] All references to other techniques captured

**CRITICAL:** If ANY item in the checklist is unchecked, you MUST go back and complete it before proceeding to Phase 2.

  - Example: `attention-mechanism-transformer`
- **MDC Filename:** Same as folder name with `.mdc` extension
  - Example: `attention-mechanism-transformer.mdc`
- **Folder Structure:** Each MDC gets its own folder within the appropriate category folder
  - Example: `ai/attention-mechanism-transformer/attention-mechanism-transformer.mdc`
  - Example: `ai/attention-mechanism-transformer/README.md`

---

## Phase 5: Base MDC Creation

### Creating the Base MDC Folder and Files

**CRITICAL:** Each MDC must be created in its own dedicated folder with both the MDC file and a README.md file.

1. **Create Folder Structure:**
   - Create a new folder within the determined category folder (e.g., `ai/`, `engines/`, etc.)
   - Folder name should be based on paper title (lowercase, hyphens, max 50 chars)
   - Example: `ai/attention-mechanism-transformer/`

2. **Create MDC File:**
   - Place the MDC file inside the new folder
   - Filename should match folder name with `.mdc` extension
   - Example: `ai/attention-mechanism-transformer/attention-mechanism-transformer.mdc`

3. **Populate MDC Content:**
   - Follow the MDC Structure Template exactly
   - Fill in all sections with extracted content
   - Ensure all code examples are properly formatted
   - Verify all formulas are in LaTeX
   - Include all performance metrics
   - Document all best practices

4. **Create README.md:**
   - Create a README.md file in the same folder as the MDC
   - The README must explain:
     - **What it is:** Description of the MDC and its purpose
     - **How it works:** Explanation of the extraction process and content structure
     - **How to use it when building:** Clear instructions on referencing and using the MDC in Cursor
   - Include paper metadata (title, authors, year)
   - List key concepts
   - Provide usage examples for Cursor
   - Include quick start guide

5. **Quality Check:**
   - Verify completeness against Pass 3 checklist
   - Ensure proper markdown formatting
   - Check code block syntax
   - Validate LaTeX formulas
   - Confirm folder structure is correct
   - Verify README.md is complete and helpful

## Phase 6: Editing Related MDCs

### Updating Existing MDCs

After creating the base MDC, you MUST:

1. **Identify Related MDCs:**
   - Search for existing MDCs that cover related topics
   - Look for MDCs that could benefit from the new paper's content
   - Identify MDCs that reference similar techniques

2. **Update Related MDCs:**
   For each related MDC found:
   - Add cross-reference to the new base MDC
   - Add new techniques from the paper if relevant
   - Enhance existing patterns with new insights
   - Add additional code examples if applicable
   - Update best practices section
   - Add to "Related Techniques" section

3. **Update Format:**
   - Add a "See Also" section pointing to the new base MDC
   - Integrate new content seamlessly
   - Maintain consistency with existing MDC style
   - Don't duplicate content, but add relevant connections

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### DO NOT:
- Skip sections because they seem "less important"
- Summarize when you should extract verbatim
- Ignore appendices or supplementary materials
- Create MDC before completing all three reading passes
- Place file in wrong folder due to incomplete topic analysis
- Forget to update related MDCs
- Miss code examples embedded in text
- Skip mathematical formulas
- Ignore performance metrics
- Create duplicate content without cross-referencing

### DO:
- Read every word of the paper
- Extract complete code examples
- Preserve all technical details
- Document all assumptions
- Cross-reference related content
- Verify completeness multiple times
- Ask for clarification if paper is unclear
- Take time to understand complex sections

---

## Python Tool Integration

When using the provided Python tools:

1. **Use `pdf_extractor.py`** to extract text from PDF files
2. **Use `content_organizer.py`** to structure the extracted content
3. **Use `paper_processor.py`** for the complete pipeline

However, **DO NOT rely solely on automated extraction**. You MUST still:
- Read the extracted content thoroughly
- Verify accuracy of extraction
- Fill in any gaps from automated processing
- Ensure complete coverage

The Python tools are aids, not replacements for thorough reading.

## Final Reminder

**THE GOLDEN RULE:** If you're unsure whether you've captured everything, you haven't. Go back and read the paper again. A complete MDC is a comprehensive cheat sheet that someone could use to understand and implement the technique without reading the original paper. If your MDC doesn't achieve that, it's incomplete.

**Remember:** You are creating a "Source of Truth" document. It must be complete, accurate, and comprehensive. There are no shortcuts.
