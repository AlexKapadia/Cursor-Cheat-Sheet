# Web Design MDCs

This folder contains MDC files for website design systems. Each subfolder contains a complete design system extracted from a website.

## Structure

```
web-design/
  └── [design-style-name]/
      ├── [design-style-name].mdc    # Complete design system
      └── README.md                   # Design system overview
```

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders to find a design style you like
2. Open the MDC file to see the complete design system
3. Reference it in Cursor Chat when building
4. Use the design tokens, components, and patterns

## Design Style Naming

MDC folders are named based on design characteristics:
- `modern-minimalist-clean-lines/` - Modern, minimalist design with clean lines
- `bold-corporate-gradient-hero/` - Bold corporate design with gradient hero
- `playful-creative-animated/` - Playful, creative design with animations

The naming makes it easy to identify and choose designs at a glance.

## Adding New Designs

When processing a new website:
1. Follow the `website-to-mdc-rules.mdc` protocol
2. Analyze the design style
3. Create a descriptive folder name
4. Generate the MDC file
5. Create a README

See the main `README.md` in the parent folder for more details.
