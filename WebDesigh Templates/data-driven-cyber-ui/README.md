# Data-Driven Cyber UI: Source of Truth

**Version:** 1.0.0

## What It Is

> **Design Philosophy:** High-Precision Data Aesthetic | Telemetry-Inspired | Mission Control Dashboard

### Key Architecture Principles

- - **Data Streams In:** Use `opacity` + `translateY` for "sliding down" effect.
- **Count Up:** Use `@keyframes` or JavaScript for number counting.
- **Glitch Reveal:** Optional text decode animation (random chars → final text).
- **Sticky Headers:** Use `position: sticky` with `top-0` and `z-10`.

## How to Use It

1. Review the `data-driven-cyber-ui.mdc` file for detailed architecture and implementation guidelines
2. Follow the architectural principles and patterns outlined in the document
3. Implement the database schemas, API contracts, and frontend components as specified
4. Refer to the code examples and best practices for integration
