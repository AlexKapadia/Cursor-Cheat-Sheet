## Main Challenges in MPS Management

### 01. Manual Meter Readings
Technicians must visit clients or remotely contact them to gather data on the number of prints.

### 02. Lack of Complete Information About the Condition of Devices
Limited visibility in real-time (e.g. outages, paper shortage, low toner level).

### 03. Difficulties in Monitoring Dispersed Printer Fleets
Many clients in different locations, lack of a uniform management system.

### 04. Costs of Misguided Service and Delivery Logistics
Shipping of the toner "just in case" or delayed responses to reports.

### 05. Difficulties in Reporting SLA and KPI
Problems with automatically generating reports on response time, consumption, or availability of devices.
