## How to Use It

1. Review the `marketplace-engine.mdc` file for detailed architecture and implementation guidelines
2. Follow the architectural principles and patterns outlined in the document
3. Implement the database schemas, API contracts, and frontend components as specified
4. Refer to the code examples and best practices for integration

## Where Information Is From

- **Primary Source:** This MDC file (`marketplace-engine.mdc`)
- The content is based on industry best practices, architectural patterns, and implementation guidelines
- Code examples and schemas are production-ready and follow modern development standards

## How to Build

### Prerequisites

- **Technologies:** Next.js, REST, React, SQL, Stripe, Supabase, Tailwind, TypeScript

### Setup Steps

1. Review the database schema and create the necessary tables
2. Set up the required services and APIs (as specified in the MDC)
