# AI Writing Rules and Guidelines

## What It Is

Write clear, concise sentences. Avoid unnecessary complexity. Break long sentences into shorter, more digestible ones when it improves clarity.

### Key Architecture Principles

- **Write for clarity first, style second.** If a sentence is unclear, simplify it.
- **Read your writing aloud.** If it sounds awkward when spoken, it probably reads awkwardly too.
- **Cut unnecessary words.** Every word should earn its place. If a word doesn't add meaning, remove it.
- **Vary sentence length.** Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones for rhythm and engagement.
- **Use specific nouns and verbs.** "The car accelerated" is better than "The vehicle moved quickly."

## How to Use It

1. Review the `ai-writing-rules.mdc` file for detailed architecture and implementation guidelines
2. Follow the architectural principles and patterns outlined in the document
3. Implement the database schemas, API contracts, and frontend components as specified
4. Refer to the code examples and best practices for integration
