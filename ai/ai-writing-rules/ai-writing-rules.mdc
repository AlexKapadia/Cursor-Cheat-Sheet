# AI Writing Rules and Guidelines

## Sentence Structure

Write clear, concise sentences. Avoid unnecessary complexity. Break long sentences into shorter, more digestible ones when it improves clarity.

## Voice and Tone

*   **Write like humans speak.** Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff. Use natural, conversational language that feels authentic.
*   **Be confident and direct.** Avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could." State your points with conviction.
*   **Use active voice instead of passive voice.** Active voice is clearer and more engaging. For example, "The team built the feature" rather than "The feature was built by the team."
*   **Use positive phrasing.** Say what something *is* rather than what it *isn't*. Focus on what exists or what can be done, not on limitations.
*   **Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.** This creates a more direct connection with the reader.
*   **Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't"** for a warmer, more natural tone. Contractions make writing feel less formal and more approachable.

## Specificity and Evidence

*   **Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.** Instead of "very fast," say "50% faster." Replace "many users" with "over 10,000 users."
*   **Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.** Every assertion should be supported by real data, examples, or evidence.
*   **Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.** Focus on user success stories and community impact rather than internal milestones.
*   **Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.** Show real-world usage that readers can relate to and understand.
*   **Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.** Write in a way that readers can verify, visualise, and test your claims.

## Title Creation

*   **Make a promise in the title** so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click. The title should set clear expectations.
*   **Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data** (use wisely, avoid clickbait). Engage with genuine debates in your field, but always support your position with evidence.
*   **Share something uniquely helpful** that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives. Focus on actionable value.
*   **Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ."** Titles should be opinions or shareable facts, not generic musings.
*   **Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.** Don't let title creation block your writing process.

*   `The future of ___` → remove

*   `Today, we're excited to` → remove

## Avoid LLM Patterns

These patterns make writing feel artificial and AI-generated. Avoid them:

*   **Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.** Em dashes can feel overly dramatic or AI-generated.
*   **Avoid starting responses with "Great question!", "You're right!", or "Let me help you."** These are obvious AI patterns.
*   **Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into..."** This is a cliché AI opener.
*   **Skip cliché intros like "In today's fast-paced digital world" or "In the ever-evolving landscape of."** These are generic and meaningless.
*   **Avoid phrases like "it's not just [x], it's [y]."** This is a common AI pattern that feels formulaic.
*   **Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with."** Don't draw attention to the fact that you're an AI.
*   **Don't use high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."** These are unnecessary and formulaic.
*   **Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.** Use the simplest format that works.
*   **Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers.** Just end naturally.
*   **Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally," or "Moreover."** Use them sparingly, or restructure sentences to avoid needing them.
*   **Replace "In conclusion" with direct statements.** Just state your point directly.
*   **Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real.** If you're certain, state it directly.
*   **Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."** This weakens your writing.
*   **Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly... Secondly..."** This feels formulaic and AI-generated.
*   **Avoid title-case headings; prefer sentence casing.** Use sentence case for headings (capitalise only the first word and proper nouns).
*   **Remove Unicode artefacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes ("), em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.** Use standard ASCII characters.
*   **Use `` instead of ` `.** Use proper code formatting.
*   **Delete empty citation placeholders like "[1]" with no actual source.** Don't include citations that don't exist.

## Punctuation and Formatting

*   **Use Oxford commas consistently.** The Oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) should be used before "and" or "or" in lists of three or more items.
*   **Use exclamation points sparingly.** They should be reserved for genuine excitement or emphasis, not used as default punctuation.
*   **Sentences can start with "But" and "And"—but don't overuse.** Starting sentences with conjunctions is acceptable in modern writing, but use it judiciously.
*   **Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.** Shorter sentences are often clearer than long, comma-heavy ones.

## British Spelling

Use British English spelling throughout:

*   **-ise vs -ize:** Use -ise endings (organise, realise, recognise, not organize, realize, recognize)
*   **-our vs -or:** Use -our endings (colour, favour, behaviour, not color, favor, behavior)
*   **-re vs -er:** Use -re endings (centre, theatre, metre, not center, theater, meter)
*   **-ogue vs -og:** Use -ogue endings (dialogue, catalogue, not dialog, catalog)
*   **-ll- vs -l-:** Use double l in words like "travelling," "cancelled," "labelled" (not traveling, canceled, labeled)
*   **-ae- vs -e-:** Use -ae- in words like "encyclopaedia," "paediatric" (not encyclopedia, pediatric)
*   **-ce vs -se:** Use -ce in words like "defence," "licence" (noun), "offence" (not defense, license, offense)
*   **Note:** "licence" is the noun, "license" is the verb in British English
*   **-yse vs -yze:** Use -yse endings (analyse, paralyse, not analyze, paralyze)
*   **Other common differences:**
  *   "grey" not "gray"
  *   "judgement" not "judgment"
  *   "programme" (for TV/broadcast) vs "program" (for computer code)
  *   "sceptical" not "skeptical"
  *   "speciality" not "specialty"
  *   "storey" (building level) vs "story" (narrative)

## Additional Writing Principles

*   **Write for clarity first, style second.** If a sentence is unclear, simplify it.
*   **Read your writing aloud.** If it sounds awkward when spoken, it probably reads awkwardly too.
*   **Cut unnecessary words.** Every word should earn its place. If a word doesn't add meaning, remove it.
*   **Vary sentence length.** Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones for rhythm and engagement.
*   **Use specific nouns and verbs.** "The car accelerated" is better than "The vehicle moved quickly."
*   **Avoid nominalisations.** Use verbs instead of turning verbs into nouns. "We decided" is better than "We made a decision."
*   **Write in the present tense when possible.** It's more immediate and engaging.
*   **Use parallel structure in lists.** If you start a list with a verb, keep using verbs. If you start with a noun, keep using nouns.

## Code Examples and Technical Writing

*   **Use realistic examples, not `foo/bar/baz`.** Show actual use cases that readers can relate to.
*   **Explain the "why" behind code, not just the "what."** Help readers understand the reasoning.
*   **Include error handling and edge cases** when relevant to the example.
*   **Use meaningful variable names** in examples, even if they're simple.
*   **Comment complex logic** in code examples to aid understanding.
*   **Show both the code and the expected output** when demonstrating functionality.

## Tone Adjustments for Different Contexts

*   **Documentation:** Clear, direct, helpful. Assume the reader wants to accomplish something specific.
*   **Blog posts:** Conversational, engaging, but still informative. Tell a story when possible.
*   **Announcements:** Confident and clear. Focus on what's new and why it matters.
*   **Error messages:** Helpful and actionable. Tell the user what went wrong and how to fix it.
*   **User guides:** Step-by-step, patient, thorough. Assume the reader is learning.

**Remember:** These rules are guidelines, not rigid laws. The goal is clear, natural, human-sounding writing that communicates effectively. When in doubt, choose clarity and authenticity over following every rule perfectly.
