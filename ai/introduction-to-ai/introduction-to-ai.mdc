## Abstract / Summary

This chapter provides a gentle introduction to AI, primarily as a broad overview of this diverse topic. Unlike the other chapters in this book, this introductory chapter is "light" in terms of technical content. However, it's easy to read and also worth skimming through its contents. Machine learning and deep learning are briefly introduced toward the end of this chapter, both of which are discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.

Keep in mind that many AI-focused books tend to discuss AI from the perspective of computer science and a discussion of traditional algorithms and data structures. By contrast, this book treats AI as an "umbrella" for machine learning and deep learning, and therefore it's discussed in a cursory manner as a precursor to the other chapters.

The first part of this chapter starts with a discussion regarding the term artificial intelligence, various potential ways to determine the presence of intelligence, as well as the difference between Strong AI and Weak AI. You will also learn about the Turing Test, which is a well-known test for intelligence.

The second part of this chapter discusses some AI uses-cases and the early approaches to neural computing, evolutionary computation, NLP, and bioinformatics.

The third part of this chapter introduces you to major subfields of AI, which include natural language processing (with NLU and NLG), machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning.

## Detailed Content

### What Is Artificial Intelligence?

The literal meaning of the word artificial is synthetic, which often has a negative connotation of being an inferior substitute. However, artificial objects (e.g., flowers) can closely approximate their counterparts, and sometimes they can be advantageous when they do not have any maintenance requirements.

By contrast, a definition for intelligence is more elusive. R. Sternberg provides the following useful definition: "Intelligence is the cognitive ability of an individual to learn from experience, to reason well, to remember important information, and to cope with the demands of daily living."

**Key Questions:**
- How do you decide if someone (something?) is intelligent?
- Are animals intelligent?
- If animals are intelligent, how do you measure their intelligence?
- Can inanimate objects, such as computers, possess intelligence?

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- We assess intelligence through interaction: asking questions and observing answers
- Animal intelligence is assessed through behavior observation
- Examples: Clever Hans (horse), dolphins (tool use, self-awareness), ant colonies (collective intelligence)

**Machine Intelligence:**
The declared goal of artificial Intelligence is to create computer software and/or hardware systems that exhibit thinking comparable to that of humans, in other words, to display characteristics usually associated with human intelligence.

**Thinking vs Intelligence:**
- Thinking: The facility to reason, analyze, evaluate, and formulate ideas and concepts
- Intelligence: Perhaps akin to efficient and effective thinking
- Not every being capable of thinking is intelligent

**Raphael's Definition:** Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by man.

### Strong AI versus Weak AI

**Weak AI Approach (MIT):**
- Views any system that exhibits intelligent behavior as an example of AI
- Focuses on whether a program performs correctly
- Not concerned with whether the artifact performs its task in the same way humans do
- Results primarily concerned with satisfactory performance
- Measures success based on performance alone
- Maintains that the raison d'être of AI research is to solve difficult problems regardless of how they are actually solved

**Strong AI Approach (Carnegie-Mellon University - Biological Plausibility):**
- When an artifact exhibits intelligent behavior, its performance should be based upon the same methodologies used by humans
- Example: For a hearing system, would simulate cochlea, hearing canal, eardrum, etc.
- Concerned with the structure of the systems they build
- Maintains that by possessing heuristics, algorithms, and knowledge, computers can possess a sense of consciousness and intelligence
- Examples in popular culture: I, Robot, Blade Runner

### The Turing Test

Alan Turing sought to answer the question of intelligence in operational terms. He wanted to separate functionality (what something does) from implementation (how something is built).

**Definition of the Turing Test:**

Turing proposed two imitation games. In the first game:
- An interrogator is in a room with a curtain
- On the other side is a person
- The interrogator must determine whether it is a man or a woman
- The man may lie, but the woman is always truthful
- Communication is via computer (not voice)
- If the man successfully deceives the interrogator, he wins

**An Interrogator Test (Second Game):**
- More appropriate to the study of AI
- An interrogator is in a room with a curtain
- A computer or a person is behind the curtain
- The machine plays the role of the male (may lie)
- The person is consistently truthful
- The interrogator asks questions to determine if communicating with a person or machine
- If the computer successfully deceives the interrogator, it passes the Turing Test and is considered intelligent

**Modern Updates:**
- New variations of the Turing test have been developed
- Tests for androids and humanoid robots
- Links provided in the chapter for current research

### Heuristics

**Definition:**
A heuristic is essentially a "rule of thumb" for solving a problem. It is a set of guidelines that often works to solve a problem. Contrast with an algorithm, which is a prescribed set of rules to solve a problem and whose output is entirely predictable.

**Characteristics:**
- Technique for finding an approximate solution
- Used when other methods are too time-consuming or too complex
- Favorable outcome is likely but not guaranteed
- Especially popular in the early days of AI

**Examples:**
- Driving directions: Proceed in the direction with more streetlights at a fork
- Recovering a dropped contact lens
- Finding parking spaces

**AI Applications:**
- Medical diagnosis
- Expert systems
- Problem-solving in complex domains

**When to Use:**
- AI problems are large and computationally complex
- Cannot be solved via straightforward algorithms
- Domains embody large amount of human expertise
- Better solved using AI than traditional computer science approaches

### Genetic Algorithms

**Definition:**
A genetic algorithm is a heuristic that "mimics" the process of natural selection, which involves selecting the fittest individuals for reproduction to sire the offspring of the subsequent generation.

**Key Concepts:**
- Based on Darwin's theory of evolution
- Natural selection in nature: thousands or millions of years
- Evolution in computers: much faster than natural selection
- Part of evolutionary computation branch of AI
- Proposed solutions adapt like animal creatures adapt to their environments

**Genetic Operators:**
- Natural selection
- Reproduction
- Mutation
- Recombination

**Evolutionary Computation:**
- Branch of AI where proposed solutions to a problem adapt
- Not solely concerned with optimization problems
- Rodney Brooks' approach: Intelligence emerges through interaction of an agent with its environment
- Multiple layers: higher layers rely upon lower layers
- Example: Obstacle avoidance built upon locomotion layer

### Knowledge Representation

**Importance:**
The issue of representation becomes important when we consider AI-related problems. AI systems that acquire and store knowledge need the ability to identify and represent that knowledge. The choice of a representation is intrinsic to the nature of problem solving and understanding.

**George Polya's Insight:**
A good representation choice is almost as important as the algorithm or solution plan devised for a particular problem. Good and natural representations facilitate fast and comprehensible solutions.

**Example: Missionaries and Cannibals Problem**
- Goal: Transfer three missionaries and three cannibals across a river
- Constraints: Boat holds max 2 people; cannibals can never outnumber missionaries on any bank
- Solution path visible by selecting appropriate representation

**Approaches:**
1. **Logic-based Solutions:** Used for knowledge representation and problem-solving
   - Example: Terry Winograd's Blocks World (1972)
   - Production rules and production systems for expert systems

2. **Semantic Networks:** Graphical representation of knowledge
   - Precede object-oriented languages
   - Use inheritance (objects inherit properties from superclasses)
   - Examples: SNePS (Semantic Net Processing System), Roger Schank's work
   - State-space representations: display all possible states of a system
