## Abstract / Summary

We discuss jump-diffusion type models for financial market as well as methods for pricing and hedging of contingent claims in such markets. We consider both, asset price and term structure models, and deal also with situations when there is a stochastic volatility correlated with the jumps and when one has very small time scales, i.e., high frequency data. To make the presentation possibly self-contained, in a preliminary section we recall some basic notions from stochastic analysis for jump-diffusions.

## Problem Statement

### Problem Definition

Most standard finance literature, particularly for pricing and hedging contingent claims, assumes that underlying asset prices follow diffusion-type processes, especially geometric Brownian motion (GBM). However, empirical studies show that such models are inadequate both in their descriptive power and in the mispricing they might induce. The problem is that returns of various asset prices and interest rates exhibit jumping behavior that cannot be adequately modeled by pure diffusion-type processes.

### Motivation

1. **Empirical Evidence:** Various empirical studies document jumping behavior in prices and interest rates (Ball and Torous, 1985; Jorion, 1988; Babbs and Webber, 1997).
2. **Inadequacy of Pure Diffusion Models:** Standard GBM models fail to capture:
   - Large sudden price movements (jumps)
   - Fat tails in return distributions
   - Volatility skews in option pricing
3. **Market Realities:** On very small time scales, actual prices change at discrete random points in time in reaction to trades and/or significant new information, rather than continuously.

### Challenges

1. **Market Incompleteness:** The introduction of jumps in the Black-Scholes model implies that derivative prices are no longer determined by the principle of absence of arbitrage alone.
2. **Systematic Jump Risk:** Early approaches (Merton, 1976) assumed jump risk was not systematic, but later studies showed jumps in stock returns are indeed systematic.
3. **Hedging Complexity:** In incomplete markets, perfect hedging is generally not possible, requiring alternative hedging strategies.
4. **Stochastic Volatility Correlation:** Empirical evidence shows correlation between jumps in volatility and jumps in prices.

### Scope

The paper covers:
- Jump-diffusion models for asset prices
- Jump-diffusion models for term structure (interest rates)
- Models with stochastic volatility correlated with jumps
- High-frequency data modeling
- Pricing methods in jump-diffusion markets
- Hedging strategies in complete and incomplete markets
- Martingale measures and market price of risk

### Assumptions

1. Jump-diffusions form a particular class of Lévy processes (not the general case)
2. Prices change continuously most of the time, with occasional larger jumps
3. The market may be incomplete when jumps are present

## Related Work and Background

### Previous Approaches

1. **Merton (1976):** First approach extending Black-Scholes model with jumps, assuming jump risk was not systematic. Later criticized as equivalent to existence of a market portfolio without jumping behavior.

2. **Cox and Ross (1976):** Considered simple jump-type process with fixed jump amplitude, keeping the market complete with a single source of randomness.

3. **Ball and Torous (1985), Jorion (1988):** Empirical studies documenting jumping behavior in prices and interest rates.

4. **Babbs and Webber (1997):** Identified specific sources of jumps in interest rates (e.g., central bank moves).

5. **Bakshi, Cao and Chen (1997):** Documented that combination of jumps and stochastic volatility leads to better fits and avoids implied volatility skews.

## Preliminaries: Stochastic Analysis for Jump-Diffusions

### 2.1. Univariate Point Processes (Poisson Jump Processes)

**Definition:** A point process is a random collection of points (jump times) on the real line.

**Poisson Process:**
- Counting process $N_t$ with intensity $\lambda > 0$
- Increments are independent
- $N_t - N_s \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda(t-s))$ for $s < t$

**Key Properties:**
- $E[N_t] = \lambda t$
- $\text{Var}(N_t) = \lambda t$
- Inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda$

### 2.2. Multivariate and Marked Point Processes

**Marked Point Process:**
- Point process with associated marks (jump sizes)
- Jump times: $\tau_1, \tau_2, \ldots$
- Jump sizes: $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots$ (marks)

**Compensated Jump Process:**
$$\tilde{N}_t = N_t - \lambda t$$

**Cox Process (Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process):**
- Intensity $\lambda_t$ is itself a stochastic process
- Conditional on the intensity path, $N_t$ is a Poisson process

### 2.3. Martingale Representation

**Martingale Representation Theorem for Jump-Diffusions:**
For a martingale $M_t$ adapted to the filtration generated by a Brownian motion $W_t$ and a Poisson process $N_t$, there exist predictable processes $\phi_t$ and $\psi_t$ such that:

$$M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t \phi_s dW_s + \int_0^t \psi_s d\tilde{N}_s$$

where $\tilde{N}_t$ is the compensated Poisson process.

### 2.4. Exponential Formula; Generalized Itô Formula

**Generalized Itô Formula for Jump-Diffusions:**

For a process $X_t$ satisfying:
$$dX_t = \mu_t dt + \sigma_t dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} \gamma_t(z) \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

and a function $f(t, X_t)$, we have:

$$df(t, X_t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dX_t + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \sigma_t^2 dt + [f(t, X_{t-} + \gamma_t(z)) - f(t, X_{t-})] * \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

**Exponential Formula:**
For a jump-diffusion process, the exponential martingale is:

$$\mathcal{E}_t = \exp\left(\int_0^t \mu_s dW_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t \mu_s^2 ds + \int_0^t \log(1+\theta_s) dN_s - \int_0^t \theta_s \lambda_s ds\right)$$

### 2.5. Absolutely Continuous Transformation of Measures

**Girsanov Transformation for Jump-Diffusions:**

Given a probability measure $P$, we can define an equivalent measure $Q$ via:

$$\frac{dQ}{dP}\bigg|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = \mathcal{E}_t$$

where $\mathcal{E}_t$ is an exponential martingale.

**Change of Measure Effects:**
- Brownian motion: $dW_t^Q = dW_t^P - \mu_t dt$
- Poisson intensity: $\lambda_t^Q = (1 + \theta_t) \lambda_t^P$
- Jump size distribution may also change

## Market Models with Jump-Diffusions

### 3.1. Asset-Price and Term Structure Models with Additive Jumps

#### 3.1.1. Asset Price Models with Jumps

**Merton Jump-Diffusion Model:**

The asset price $S_t$ follows:

$$dS_t = S_{t-}\left[\mu dt + \sigma dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} (e^z - 1) \tilde{N}(dt, dz)\right]$$

or equivalently:

$$S_t = S_0 \exp\left(\mu t + \sigma W_t - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 t + \sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Y_i\right)$$

where:
- $\mu$: drift coefficient
- $\sigma$: volatility coefficient
- $W_t$: Brownian motion
- $N_t$: Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$
- $Y_i$: jump sizes (typically normally distributed: $Y_i \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$)

**Log-Price Process:**
$$d\log S_t = \left(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right) dt + \sigma dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} z \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

**Characteristic Function:**
For Merton model with $Y_i \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$:

$$E[e^{iu \log S_t}] = \exp\left(iu \log S_0 + iu\mu t - \frac{1}{2}iu\sigma^2 t - \frac{1}{2}u^2\sigma^2 t + \lambda t(e^{iu\mu_J - \frac{1}{2}u^2\sigma_J^2} - 1)\right)$$

#### 3.1.2. Term Structure Models with Jumps

**Short Rate Model with Jumps:**

$$dr_t = \kappa(\theta - r_t) dt + \sigma \sqrt{r_t} dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} z \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

where:
- $\kappa$: mean reversion speed
- $\theta$: long-term mean
- $\sigma$: volatility
- Jumps affect the short rate directly

**Forward Rate Model:**

$$df(t, T) = \alpha(t, T) dt + \sigma(t, T) dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} \gamma(t, T, z) \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

### 3.2. Jump-Diffusion Models Driven by Hidden Jump Processes

**Hidden Jump Process Model:**

The volatility itself follows a jump-diffusion:

$$dV_t = \kappa_V(\theta_V - V_t) dt + \sigma_V \sqrt{V_t} dW_t^V + \int_{\mathbb{R}} z_V \tilde{N}_V(dt, dz_V)$$

with correlation between:
- Price jumps and volatility jumps
- Brownian motions: $d\langle W, W^V \rangle_t = \rho dt$

**Correlated Jumps:**
- When volatility jumps, price typically also jumps
- Natural expectation: if volatility jumps, price should jump (Naik, 1993)

### 3.3. Asset Prices as Diffusions Sampled at the Jump Times of a Jump Process

**High-Frequency Data Model:**

For very small time scales, prices change at discrete random points:

$$S_t = X_{\tau_{N_t}}$$

where:
- $X_t$: continuous diffusion process
- $\tau_n$: jump times of a point process
- $N_t$: counting process

This captures the discrete nature of actual price changes at high frequencies.

## Martingale Measures: Existence and Uniqueness

### Market Price of Risk and Market Completion

**Fundamental Question:** When does an equivalent martingale measure exist? When is it unique?

### 4.1. The Case of Jump-Diffusion Asset Price Models

**Market Price of Risk:**

For a jump-diffusion asset price model, the market price of risk has two components:

1. **Diffusion Risk Premium:** $\theta_t$ (affects Brownian motion)
2. **Jump Risk Premium:** $\phi_t(z)$ (affects jump intensity and size distribution)

**Radon-Nikodym Derivative:**

$$\frac{dQ}{dP}\bigg|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = \mathcal{E}_t = \exp\left(\int_0^t \theta_s dW_s - \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t \theta_s^2 ds + \int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}} \log(1+\phi_s(z)) \tilde{N}(ds, dz) - \int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi_s(z) \lambda_s \nu(dz) ds\right)$$

**Existence Conditions:**
- Novikov-type conditions for the exponential martingale
- Integrability conditions on $\theta_t$ and $\phi_t(z)$

**Uniqueness:**
- Market is complete if and only if there is a unique equivalent martingale measure
- With jumps, market is typically incomplete
- Uniqueness requires specific conditions on jump structure

**Market Completion:**
- Add additional traded assets to complete the market
- Use additional derivatives to span the jump risk
- Results in unique martingale measure

### 4.2. The Case of Jump-Diffusion Term Structure Models

**HJM Framework with Jumps:**

For forward rates:
$$df(t, T) = \alpha(t, T) dt + \sigma(t, T) dW_t + \int_{\mathbb{R}} \gamma(t, T, z) \tilde{N}(dt, dz)$$

**No-Arbitrage Condition (HJM Drift Condition with Jumps):**

$$\alpha(t, T) = \sigma(t, T) \int_t^T \sigma(t, u) du + \int_{\mathbb{R}} \gamma(t, T, z) \left(e^{\int_t^T \gamma(t, u, z) du} - 1\right) \lambda_t \nu(dz)$$

**Market Price of Risk:**
- Determines the drift adjustment
- Affects both diffusion and jump components
- May not be unique (incomplete market)

## Hedging in Jump-Diffusion Market Models

### 5.1. Hedging when the Market is Completed

#### 5.1.1. Asset-Price Models

**Complete Market Hedging:**

When the market is complete (unique martingale measure exists), every contingent claim can be perfectly hedged using a self-financing portfolio.

**Hedging Portfolio:**
- Hold $\Delta_t$ units of the underlying asset
- Hold risk-free bonds
- Portfolio value: $V_t = \Delta_t S_t + B_t$

**Delta Hedging:**
$$\Delta_t = \frac{\partial C(t, S_t)}{\partial S}$$

where $C(t, S)$ is the option price.

**Self-Financing Condition:**
$$dV_t = \Delta_t dS_t + r(V_t - \Delta_t S_t) dt$$

#### 5.1.2. Term Structure Models

**Hedging Interest Rate Derivatives:**

- Use multiple bonds with different maturities
- Delta-gamma hedging
- Duration and convexity matching

### 5.2. Hedging when the Market is not Complete

**Incomplete Market Hedging Strategies:**

1. **Risk Minimization (Föllmer-Sondermann):**
   - Minimize the variance of the hedging error
   - Use the minimal martingale measure
   - Quadratic hedging criterion

2. **Local Risk Minimization (Föllmer-Schweizer):**
   - Minimize risk locally in time
   - Allows non-self-financing strategies
   - More flexible than global risk minimization

3. **Mean-Variance Hedging:**
   - Minimize $E[(H_T - V_T)^2]$ where $H_T$ is the claim payoff
   - Requires specification of the physical measure

4. **Utility-Based Hedging:**
   - Maximize expected utility
   - Depends on investor's risk preferences

**Risk-Minimizing Strategy:**

For a claim with payoff $H_T$, the risk-minimizing strategy $\xi_t$ satisfies:

$$\xi_t = \frac{d\langle S, H \rangle_t}{d\langle S, S \rangle_t}$$

where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the predictable quadratic covariation.

## Pricing in Jump-Diffusion Models

### 6.1. General Aspects

**Risk-Neutral Pricing:**

When an equivalent martingale measure $Q$ exists:

$$C(t, S_t) = E^Q\left[e^{-r(T-t)} H_T \middle| \mathcal{F}_t\right]$$

**Pricing PDE (when applicable):**

For European options, the price $C(t, S)$ satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + rS\frac{\partial C}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} - rC + \lambda \int_{\mathbb{R}} [C(t, Se^z) - C(t, S)] \nu(dz) = 0$$

with boundary condition $C(T, S) = H(S)$.

**Characteristic Function Method:**

For models with known characteristic function:

$$C(t, S_t) = e^{-r(T-t)} E^Q[H(S_T) | \mathcal{F}_t]$$

Can be computed using Fourier inversion:

$$C(t, S_t) = \frac{e^{-r(T-t)}}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-iu \log S_T} \hat{H}(u) \phi_T(u) du$$

where $\phi_T(u)$ is the characteristic function and $\hat{H}(u)$ is the Fourier transform of the payoff.

### 6.2. Computational Aspects

**Monte Carlo Simulation:**

1. Simulate jump-diffusion paths under risk-neutral measure
2. Compute discounted payoffs
3. Average over many paths

**Algorithm:**
```
For i = 1 to N:
  S_T = S_0
  For t = 0 to T with step dt:
    Generate Z ~ N(0,1)
    Generate jump indicator: J ~ Poisson(λ dt)
    If J > 0:
      Generate jump size Y ~ ν(dz)
      S_t = S_t * exp(Y)
    S_t = S_t * exp((r - 0.5*σ²)dt + σ√dt * Z)
  Payoff_i = H(S_T)
Price = e^(-rT) * mean(Payoff_i)
```

**Finite Difference Methods:**

Solve the pricing PDE numerically using:
- Explicit schemes
- Implicit schemes
- Crank-Nicolson scheme

**Fourier Methods:**

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for characteristic function pricing
- Efficient for European options
- Can handle complex jump structures

**Series Expansion Methods:**

For Merton model, the option price can be written as:

$$C = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-\lambda T}(\lambda T)^n}{n!} C_{BS}(S_n, K, T, r, \sigma_n)$$

where:
- $C_{BS}$ is the Black-Scholes formula
- $S_n = S_0 e^{n\mu_J + \frac{1}{2}n\sigma_J^2}$
- $\sigma_n^2 = \sigma^2 + n\sigma_J^2/T$
